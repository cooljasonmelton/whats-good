The logo fashioned to the side of the truck, standing equal my own height, was a bucket of red paint pouring onto the Earth. A cartoon depiction of their motto, 'Cover the Earth'. I was excited. I sped up next to him, pulling my arm up and down. A signal requesting him to blow his horn. I don't even know if he obliged as I blew past him on the expressway, for some reason, completely happy for the next 10 minutes."
